This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

- Products Listing using a mocked Json file
- Totally adaptable to any number of products
- Partially responsive (it adapt very well to desktop resolutions)
- Global state Management using Context API
- Styled using SCSS Modules
- SSG in the home page for static pages generation
- Typescript good practices
- Atomic design pattern
- Bonus: i created a simples Product Page and compiled all products in static pages using getStaticPaths to take fully advantage of the NextJS and SSG capabilities

## Final thoughts
